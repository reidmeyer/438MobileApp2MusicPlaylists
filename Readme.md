Last.fm app

Creative
1. I made a share button on the activity detail page so the user can share the song url with friends through messaging, email, etc. 

2. added a scroll bar to the recycler views

3. I decided to add the artist to the top tracks and results fields since I thought it would be more user friendly.

4. I lastly made it so there would be a link on the activity page that would direct the user to the first link when you google youtube + track name + artist name, essentially forwarding the user to youtube. This required use of a url encoder.
